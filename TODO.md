# TODOs

Some ideas and thoughts about what could be done next to make the application better.

- Add some full end-to-end tests
- Make the front-end prettier
- Format recognised postcodes nicely when displayed back to the user
- Tell users that unrecognised postcodes are unrecognised
- Gracefully handle the API being slow or unavailable
- Add GitHub actions for testing
